Light weight frontend user registration and login plugin.

== Description ==

= The only lightweight user profile plugin for WordPress. UsersWP features front end user profile, users directory, a registration and a login form. =

While BuddyPress, Ultimate Member, Profile Builder and similar plugins are excellent, we wanted to create something much lighter and simpler to use.

Something that could be gentle on your server resources. With less options to make it easy to setup, more hooks to make it infinitely extensible.

Today UsersWP is by far the simplest solution available to manage users on WordPress. It takes seconds to setup, it is super fast and it's perfect to create a community of users within your website.

= FEATURES =

* Drag and Drop profile builder with all kind of user profile custom fields.
* Shortcode for the Login form
* Shortcode for the Registration form
* Shortcode for the Edit Account form
* Shortcode for the Users Directory
* Shortcode for the User profile
* Shortcode for the Password Recovery form
* Shortcode for the Change Password form
* Shortcode for the Reset Password form
* Custom menu items like login/logout links and links to relevant pages.

After activation all pages are created with the correct shortcodes so that you are good to go in seconds.

= User Profile =

The user profile features a cover image, an avatar and an optional tabbed menu showing :

* User's posts
* User's comments
* Custom fields (if any)

You can chose if you want to hide any section of it and where to show the custom fields. In a sidebar or in their own tab.

Otherwise just customize the templates as you wish within your child theme.
